<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

The app is an official attempt to improve on the flaws of the official Kronox app, of which there are a lot.

The primary aim is to make viewing your schedule as painless and simple as possible, so you can focus on your studies, rather than struggling with accessing an overview of your upcoming classes.
<br>

## Some of the key features are:

* Find any Kronox schedule available on the Kronox website, but in a user friendly way.

* Set notifications for specific classes or entire courses.

* Sign in to your KronoX account through your University.

* Book rooms in buildings at your school.

* Sign up for exams.

* Choose between multiple languages.

* Change colors for different courses in the schedule view

* List, week and calendar view available for viewing schedules.

* Merge multiple schedules into one, and choose which to display through the settings menu.


<br>

## Currently the app supports the following colleges in Sweden:

* Kristianstad University

* Malmö University

* Örebro University

* Luleå University of Technology

* University of Gävle

* University of Södertörn

* University West (Högskolan Väst)

* University of Borås

* Mälardalens University
